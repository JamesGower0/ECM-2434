        You will notice that your bird has 'Mood'. <br>
        This will decrease every hour in the afternoon, so make sure you answer the quiz questions every day 
        for your Bird to stay happy! <br>
        In case you Bird's mood is at 0, your NestPoints will start to decrease, so make sure you play daily! <br>
